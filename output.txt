It looks to me like if the program decides to use colour:dark as the first key, then it only sees the key values with price 4368, and doesn't think to look at the size: small options.
It works some of the time, because it has a 1/x chance of picking the color as the key before the size. This could happen with other values too. In this case, if it's a large dark hoodie,
sometimes it will say "okay, large then dark, value is 4212." but other times it will say "okay, dark then large, but dark doesn't have a key for large.... value is <nil>!"
There are other examples where this will also be an issue. A white 3xl hoodie: if the first key is 3xl, white will be <nil>, but if the first key is white, then it will evaluate 4108.

This is caused either because we're not creating maps for every single possible iteration, or because the map of dark:map[small,medium,dark,white] is being
overwritten by the map dark:map[xl,2xl,3xl] because they both have the key "dark" for this example.
